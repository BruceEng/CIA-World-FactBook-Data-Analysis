Interesting Global Facts Uncovered via Data Analysis

The World Factbook, also known as the CIA World Factbook, is a reference resource produced by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) with almanac-style information about the countries of the world. It is frequently used as a resource for academic research papers and news articles.

In this project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook found [here](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/ "here"), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth.

**I did plenty of extra research over and above what is called for in this Guided Project and came across very interesting information. For example, you will find out what island is known as "Mutiny on The Bounty" Island and hear some interesting things about it via Youtube Video.**
